# **The Implementation of Symplectic Matroids**

## What is symplectic matroids?
 1998, A.V. Borvik, I.M. Gelfand, N. White construct the idea of special generization of matroid [1]. 1968, P. Sarvepalli found that the representation of symplectic matroids is parity check matrix of quantum code (stabilizer codes).

## What can this notebook do?
- To check the concrete example of concept appearing in the symplectic matroids and it's preliminary.
- To find the nontrivial representable uniform symplectic matroids

In thesis [1], some *admissible* concept, and this notebook help you to understand the concept.

## What is uniform symplectic matroids?
This is Analogy of uniform matroids. It is found in the process of my graduation research. The Base is made from a family of $k$
-admissible subsets of ground set $J$. I proved that using representation of uniform matroids $A$ and diagonal matrix D (with no 0 column vector), uniform symplectic matroids is represented by $(A \mid AD)$. However, I think there may be another representation and more generized method to represent.
